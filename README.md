# 🍃 AI-Powered Autonomous Leaf Detection System (Phase 1)

![Main Project Banner](assets/main_banner.png)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project represents the **computer vision module (Phase 1)** of an autonomous agricultural robot designed for plant disease monitoring. Utilizing a **YOLO-based object detection architecture**, this model detects plant leaves in complex greenhouse environments with high precision.

It is specifically engineered to overcome common agricultural challenges such as **occlusion** (overlapping leaves), **variable lighting** (backlight/shadows), and **visual similarities** (distinguishing green tomatoes from green leaves).

> **Current Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Completed (Detection) | 🔄 Phase 2 (Disease Classification) In Progress

## 🏆 Key Performance Metrics
The model was trained for **120 epochs** on approximately **10,000 labeled instances** at **1024px input resolution (imgsz=1024)**.

| Metric | Score | Significance |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **mAP@50** | **0.83** | High detection accuracy |
| **Precision** | **0.83** | Low false positive rate |
| **F1-Score** | **0.76** | Optimal precision–recall balance |
